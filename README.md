This is an old final project from a Modeling Complex Systems class at UVM that ran during the Fall of 2018.
Isolated from ([the old repo](https://github.com/djberenberg/modeling-cplx-sys)) because it's still cool to me. 
We created an instantaneous model for voting under various systems that supported "complex" opinion and measured how
agreable the voted-in candidate was to a population's opinion space.
