%%%%%%%%%%%% Experiments \& Methods
We create 100 different sample populations, each of size $N = 10,000$, where each opinion vector of $d=7$ for each person is drawn at random from U$(-1,1)$.
We iterate through each population and run through the each algorithm presented in Section \ref{sec:voting_systems}.
For this initial trial, we randomly select $k=10$ nominees from each population to hold an election.
The masking of opinions for a single candidate in a sample population is determined and then kept constant as each voting system is run.
Thus for a transparency level of $t$, for a population $P_i$, the voting system is the only variable changing in the system.
